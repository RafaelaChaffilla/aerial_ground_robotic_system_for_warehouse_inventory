# aerial_ground_robotic_system_for_warehouse_inventory
### Description:
ROS packages for UAV-UGV collaboration for warehouse inventory missions.

This repository contains code that is intended to be used on the two different robots and is divided into two folders:

 1. **ugv_packages**: Contains the necessary packages for the UGV localization module, and packages for the simulation of the warehouse environment and sensors. These packages were designed for *ROS Melodic*.
 2.  **uav_packages**: Contains the necessary packages for the UAV ArUco-based localization module, integration with ArduPilot through MAVROS and the high-level coordination node between the UAV and the UGV. These packages were designed for *ROS Noetic*.
 
A more in depth description of each folder can be found in their respective README.md files.

### Installation:
The installation guide for each robot is found in its respective folder.
